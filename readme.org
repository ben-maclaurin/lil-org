* ðŸ¦„ lil-org
lil-org is an experimental Emacs config built with simplicity and note-taking in mind. 

I wanted a simple note pad with the following features:

- *fast initialisation time (.5s):* integrates only two packages: [[https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el][expand-region]] and [[https://github.com/protesilaos/spacious-padding][spacious-padding]]. =emacs-init-time= is 0.5 seconds
- *feels native:* looks and feels right at home on macOS. lil-org is inspired by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextEdit][TextEdit]] and [[https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/bike/][Bike]]
- *beginner friendly:* lil-org acts as a gentle intro to [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]]

...so I built lil-org! PRs/improvements warmly welcomed.

Keybindings:

- driven by standard Emacs keybindings
- =Ctrl + l= to expand selection
- =Ctrl + ;= to contract selection
- =Cmd + Shift + C= to copy entire buffer to clipboard
- =Meta + n= to jump 8 lines forward
- =Meta + p= to jump 8 lines back
